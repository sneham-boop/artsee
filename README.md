## Getting Started
1. Fork it, clone it on your machine and `cd artsee`

2. Then install all dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

3. Get an API token for using Artsy's API [here](https://developers.artsy.net/)

4. Add that token to your .env file. Also, have a .gitignore file to prevent all kinds of nonsense from getting committed.

5. Now, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Woohoo! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
